ðŸ“„ Project Title
Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

1. Objective
The objective of this project is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their text content, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

2. Description
This project processes textual movie reviews, cleans the data using NLP techniques, and trains a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the sentiment of unseen reviews.
It is useful for:
Businesses to understand audience opinion
Automating feedback classification
Data-driven decision making in media & entertainment

3. Languages & Libraries Used
Language: Python 3.x

4. Installation Instructions
Step 1 â€“ Install Python
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. You can check:
bash
Copy
Edit
python --version

Step 2 â€“ Install Required Libraries
Open terminal / command prompt and run:

â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ movie_sentiment.py   # Main Python script
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset.csv          # Dataset file
â””â”€â”€ README.txt           # Instructions
Dataset Format (dataset.csv):
review	sentiment
This movie was fantastic!	positive
Worst film ever, total waste of time	negative

6. How the Code Works
Load Dataset â†’ Reads the CSV file containing reviews and sentiment labels.
Text Preprocessing â†’ Removes punctuation, stopwords, converts to lowercase, tokenizes words.
Feature Extraction â†’ Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical vectors.
Model Training â†’ Trains a Logistic Regression classifier.
Prediction â†’ Takes new user input and predicts sentiment.

7. How to Run the Code
Open terminal in the project folder.

Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
python movie_sentiment.py
The program will:
Train the model
Ask you to enter a review for testing
Output Positive or Negative

8. Sample Output
yaml
Copy
Edit
Training Accuracy: 0.87
Enter a movie review: The movie was thrilling and well-acted!
Predicted Sentiment: Positive

9. Applications
Film review classification
E-commerce product feedback sentiment
Social media text opinion mining

10. Limitations
Accuracy depends on dataset quality

Slang or sarcasm may cause misclassification

Only works on English text unless retrained for other languages
